        <p>
          Happy special birthday! To the one who brightens up my world..
          <br /><br />
          On this special day, I want to shower you with all the love and joy
          you deserve.
          <br /><br />
          You're not just a year older; you're another year more beautiful, more
          amazing, and more loved.
          <br /><br />
          Thank you for being the incredible person you are and for bringing so
          much happiness into my life.
